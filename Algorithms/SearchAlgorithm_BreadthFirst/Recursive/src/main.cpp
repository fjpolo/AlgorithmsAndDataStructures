/**
 * \brief    Breadth-First Search Algorithm - Recursive Implementation
 *          
 *           BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching
 *          tree or graph data structures. It starst at tht tree
 *          root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes 
 *          referred to as "search key") and explores the neighbor
 *          nodes first before moving to the next-level neigbours.
 * 
 *           BFS is a graph traversak algorithm that explores vertices
 *          in the order of their distance from the source vertex, where
 *          distance is the minimum length of a path from the source vertex
 *          to the node.
 * 
 *           Applications:
 *              - Copying garbage collection, Chenney's Algo
 *              - Finding the shortest path between two nodes u and v,
 *              with path length measured by the total number of edges
 *              (an advantage over depth-first search)
 *              - Testing a graph for bipartiteness
 *              - Minimum spanning tree for an unweighted graph
 *              - Web crawler
 *              - Finding nodes in any connected component of a graph
 *              - For-Fulkerson method for computing flow in a flor
 *              network
 *              - Serialization/Deserialization of a binary tree vs 
 *              serialization in sorted order allows the tree to be 
 *              reconstructed efficiently
